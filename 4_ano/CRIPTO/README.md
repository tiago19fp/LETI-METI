# Criptografia e Seguran√ßa em Redes (Cryptography and Network Security)

* Establish the security of a system with respect to a security model (security objective/attacker model); 
* Select cryptographic techniques and protocols that meet different types of security requirements;
* Explain computational security arguments based on security reductions; 
* Take advantage of the use of standard cryptographic protocols in establishing secure channels in communication networks.
